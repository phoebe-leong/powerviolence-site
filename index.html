			<h2>What is powerviolence</h2>
			<p>
				Powerviolence is an extreme subgenre of hardcore punk, emphasising rawness, speed, abrupt tempo changes, and short songs.<br>It was most popular in the 1990s. Recently the genre has seen a rise in popularity again.

			<h2>Bands / Albums</h2>
			<p>
				In the 90s, there were a few influential, popular bands. Namely Siege (the band that started it all), Spazz, Capitalist Casualties, among others.<br><br>

				In 1984, Siege's demo was released. It sounded like nothing else in hardcore at that time. It wasn't crossover, it wasn't normal hardcore, it wasn't grindcore.<br>Their demo was the only music they released, but they started a whole new movement; what is now known as powerviolence.<br><br>

				Spazz is also a well known powerviolence band, known for their weird and nerdy humour, samples from kung-fu films and B movies, and occasional use of hip-hop beats<br>as well as absurdly long song titles (e.g., "A Prayer For Complete And Utter Eradication of All Generic Pop-Punk"). Most likely due to the recent resurgence in powerviolence popularity, <a href="https://tankcrimes.com" target="_blank">Tankcrimes</a> has re-released Spazz's discography.<br><br>

				With the new surge in popularity of powerviolence, of course came new powerviolence bands.<br><br>

				In my search for powerviolence things, I came across this <a href="https://www.exotope.com/siege/" target="_blank">incredibly interesting webpage</a> all about Siege's first show at their school's Battle of the Bands.<br>Apparently the website's author was a student at the school during the competition and worked on its local newspaper.
